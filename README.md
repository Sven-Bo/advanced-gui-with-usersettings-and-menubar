# Create an advanced GUI app with PySimpleGUI (Full Tutorial)

In this tutorial, I'm going to walk you through the process of creating a GUI app with Python. I'll show you how to create an advanced Graphical User Interface complete with buttons, input boxes, user settings and a custom menu bar. I'll start with a simple GUI app that has just two buttons. Then, we'll create a more advanced GUI app to retrieve and save user settings. Finally, we will implement a custom menu bar and convert our code into a standalone executable file.<br/>

In the final application, you can convert a selected Excel sheet into a CSV file. Additionally, you could specify the separator & decimal value for the CSV file.

## Features
- Load/Save user settings
- Custom Toolbar
- Convert Excel Files to CSV
